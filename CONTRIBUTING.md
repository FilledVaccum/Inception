# Contributing to JAIS Model Quantization Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the JAIS Model Quantization Project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or request features
- Provide detailed information including:
  - Python version and environment details
  - GPU/CUDA information (if applicable)
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Error messages and stack traces

### Submitting Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for testing)
- Git

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Inception.git
cd Inception

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest black flake8 isort
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_quantization.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## üìù Code Style

### Python Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting: `black .`
- Use isort for import sorting: `isort .`
- Use flake8 for linting: `flake8 .`

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Clear all outputs before committing
- Include markdown cells explaining complex operations
- Keep cells focused and modular
- Add error handling for production code

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Comment complex algorithms and model configurations

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage
- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Test both successful and error cases
- Include integration tests for model loading/inference

### Model Testing
- Test with different model sizes when possible
- Verify quantization doesn't break functionality
- Check memory usage improvements
- Validate output quality
